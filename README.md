# MUSIC_ANALYSIS
ANALYZE RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN A PIECE OF MUSIC TO LEAD TO MORE DISCOVERIES IN MUSIC/SOUND THERAPIES THROUGH THE USE OF RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS AND VARIOUS DATA GATHERED FROM SCORES OF MUSIC THAT GIVES A USER A BETTER SENSE OF WELL BEING GIVEN THE ARCHITECTURE OF MUSIC.


"it is not yet clear which type of music should be proposed and which processes support the effects (pleasure? Distraction? Something else?). It is our opinion that research should aim to bridge these gaps, certainly not an easy task, maybe starting from some precise considerations on music."


DEFINE MUSIC INTELLIGENCE:--
--ATTEMPT AT MODELING VARIOUS ACTIVITIES IN MUSIC RELATED TO PERCEPTION,LEARNING, AND GENERATION

-- USAGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE , NEURAL NETWORKS, PROBABILISTIC REASONING.

-- HOW MANY CLASSES (2 CURRENTLY)?
-(AUTOMATIC MUSIC ANALYSIS/ INTERACTIVE MUSIC SYSTEMS)

--AUTOMATIC(APPLY ALGORITHMIC TECHNIQUES FOR ANALYSIS (MELODIC/HARMONIC/RHYTMIC) STRUCTURES OF PIECES OF MUSIC UNDER EXAMINATION

--INTERACTIVE(CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO ACTIONS OF MUSICAL PERFORMANCE)
--EX:BEAT TRACKER

THIS ANALYSIS KEEP THE INTEGRITY OF THE MUSIC TO PROPERLY CLASSIFY THE MUSIC.
THE PROCESS OF EXPLORING THE DATA , AS WELL AS SOME DATA AUGMENTATION WITH THE USE OF NEURAL NETWORKS 

THE EXPLORATION OF THE DATA WILL DETERMINE THE TYPE OF DATA STRUCTURE WHETHER IT IS(NOMINAL,INTERVAL,ETC..)  WHICH WELL IN TURN HELP TO DETERMINE THE METHOD OF DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION / FEATURE CLEANSING.
